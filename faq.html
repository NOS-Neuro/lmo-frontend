            <h3>What does the VizAI Scan actually do?</h3>
            <p>
              The scan estimates how major language models are likely to describe
              your business based on your name, website, and context. It then
              produces Discovery, Accuracy, and Authority scores along with
              human-readable findings.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does VizAI call real AI models?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. VizAI uses a secure backend to call large language models via
              API. The scan output you see is generated specifically for your
              business input, not pulled from a static template.
            </p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can VizAI see private information or internal systems?</h3>
            <p>
              No. VizAI only works with the information you provide (business
              name, website) and with public-facing knowledge that models would be
              expected to have. It does not connect to your internal tools unless
              you explicitly choose to integrate them in the future.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is this a replacement for SEO?</h3>
            <p>
              No. SEO and LMO complement each other. SEO focuses on search engine
              rankings; LMO focuses on how AI systems describe and recommend you.
              Most mature teams invest in both.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How often should we run a VizAI Scan?</h3>
            <p>
              For most organizations, quarterly is a good starting point. If your
              offerings or messaging change frequently, monthly scans can provide
              tighter monitoring.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What happens after the scan?</h3>
            <p>
              You can keep the scan as a one-time snapshot, or engage VizAI as an
              ongoing LMO partner. Ongoing work usually includes truth file
              maintenance, ecosystem seeding, and drift monitoring.
            </p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can we white-label VizAI for our clients?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. Agencies can bundle VizAI under their own brand while using our
              diagnostic engine in the background. See
              <a href="agencies.html">VizAI for Agencies</a> for more details.

            <h3>How do we get started?</h3>
            <p>
              Run a free VizAI Scan, review your scores, and then reach out via
              the contact page if you’d like a deeper LMO engagement.
