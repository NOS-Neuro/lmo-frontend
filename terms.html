        <p>
          By accessing or using the VizAI website or VizAI Scan (the “Service”),

        <h2 style="margin-top: 24px;">2. Use of the Service</h2>
        <p>
          You may use VizAI for lawful purposes and in accordance with these

        <h2 style="margin-top: 24px;">3. No guarantees</h2>
        <p>
          VizAI provides diagnostic information and recommendations based on our
          best efforts and the behavior of external AI models. We cannot guarantee
          specific business outcomes, rankings, or AI responses, and you should
          treat the results as guidance rather than absolute fact.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 24px;">4. Intellectual property</h2>
        <p>
          The VizAI name, branding, and underlying technology are owned by the

          To the maximum extent permitted by law, VizAI will not be liable for any
          indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from your use of
          the Service. Your sole remedy for dissatisfaction with the Service is to

        <p>
          We may modify, suspend, or discontinue parts of the Service at any time.
          We may also update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the
          Service after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.
