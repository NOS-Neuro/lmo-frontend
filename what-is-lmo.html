          Language Model Optimization, explained.
        </h1>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
          Search engines used to be the main discovery layer. Today, AI assistants
          answer questions before people ever see a website. Language Model
          Optimization (LMO) is how you make sure those assistants get your story right.

        <p class="section-subtitle">
          SEO helped businesses show up on results pages. LMO helps them show up
          correctly inside systems like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

            <h3>🤖 AI is answering, not just linking</h3>
            <p>
              When someone asks an assistant for a recommendation, it responds with
              an opinionated answer, not a list of links. If your business profile is
              weak or inaccurate, you’re invisible in that answer.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="why-card">
            <h3>📚 Models build internal “profiles”</h3>
            <p>
              Language models compress the web into internal knowledge. They decide
              what your company does, where you are, and who you’re for. That picture
              can drift over time if it isn’t maintained.

          <div class="why-card">
            <h3>🧭 Facts need a single source of truth</h3>
            <p>
              Models read websites, APIs, directories, and reviews. LMO gives them a
              clear, structured source of truth so your official story wins over
              outdated or conflicting data.
            </p>

          <div class="why-card">
            <h3>📊 It’s measurable</h3>
            <p>
              LMO isn’t guesswork. Discovery, Accuracy, and Authority scores give you
              a concrete way to track how AI sees your business over time.

            <h3>🔍 Discovery</h3>
            <p>
              How reliably models can find and recognize your business for relevant
              questions and use-cases.
            </p>
            <p class="pillar-mini">
              If the model can’t find you, it can’t recommend you.

            <h3>🧠 Accuracy</h3>
            <p>
              Whether your services, locations, and differentiators are described
              correctly and consistently.
            </p>
            <p class="pillar-mini">
              Clear, up-to-date facts prevent confusion and lost trust.

            <h3>🏛 Authority</h3>
            <p>
              How much confidence models have in your data compared to directories,
              aggregators, or competitors.

            <p class="pillar-mini">
              Strong authority means your perspective is the one models lean on.
